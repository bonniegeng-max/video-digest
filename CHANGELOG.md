# Changelog

## 2.0.5 — 2026-09-17

- Merged managed transcript retrieval into the single fetch helper.
- Removed the separate retrieval script and its language-specific synonym table.
- Kept exact keyword, timestamp-window, and sparse-list retrieval as JSON modes.

## 2.0.4 — 2026-09-17

- Removed localized natural-language UI behavior from helper scripts.
- Standardized helper output on JSON, status codes, and source transcript text.
- Kept all user-facing explanations in the agent layer, which follows the user's request language.

## 2.0.3 — 2026-09-17

- Merged the read-only Doctor into `fetch_video.py --doctor` so the runtime helper contains both readiness and caption-fetching behavior.
- Removed automatic package-install metadata that unnecessarily exposed the `yt-dlp` executable; installation remains an explicit, hashed user-approved step.
- Changed CLI language handling to local-language detection with arbitrary language input and English fallback.
- Made Chinese-to-English technical synonym expansion explicitly opt-in with `--synonyms zh-en`.

## 2.0.2 — 2026-09-17

- Replaced the shared predictable cache with a current-user-specific cache root.
- Added owner, type, and `0700` permission validation for every cache directory.
- Added atomic `0600` writes and rejected symbolic links at leaf output paths.
- Tightened transcript retrieval to the same ownership and permission checks.
- Removed automatic localhost proxy-port scanning from Doctor.
- Required explicit CLI language selection and added a visible network disclosure.
- Narrowed bare-link activation with clear non-trigger examples.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-09-17

- Declared the Doctor, temporary cache writes, transcript retrieval, and agent note-generation layers in the top-level manifest description.
- Added explicit temporary-write scope to allowed tools.
- Clarified the boundary between caption fetching and Research-mode web verification.
- Replaced ambiguous autonomy wording with host confirmation requirements for every state-changing action.
- Increased fixed localhost port-probe timeouts to avoid a scanner false positive.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-16

- Repositioned the skill as `Video Deep Reader`.
- Added Quick, Deep, Research, and Batch Quick output contracts.
- Made a bare YouTube URL sufficient to trigger a useful Quick result.
- Added a transcript-first fallback when YouTube subtitles are unavailable.
- Added a read-only environment Doctor.
- Pinned `yt-dlp==2026.8.19` with a verified wheel hash.
- Replaced subprocess execution with the pinned `yt-dlp` Python API.
- Restricted proxy input to a loopback port without credentials.
- Moved fetched material from persistent Documents storage to a managed temporary cache.
- Restricted follow-up retrieval to valid video IDs in the managed cache.
